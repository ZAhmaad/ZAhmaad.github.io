I am a PhD Scholar at Ca'Foscari University, Venice. My aim is to make the internet a secure place. My research focuses on privacy and security-related issues on the internet,  data measurements,  and GDPR. I'm currently working  with  [Software and System Verification (SSV)](https://ssv.dais.unive.it/people/)  research group under the supervision of  [Stefano Calzavara](https://www.dais.unive.it/~calzavara/).  I have also worked as a research intern with Secure Web Application Group under the supervision of [Ben Stock](https://swag.cispa.saarland/people/benstock.html) at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). 

Before that, I obtained my master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from CQUPT China in 2019 and got Outstanding Graduate Award. I worked under the supervision of [Rong Chai](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81456622539).
